### Cytotoxicity (Antineoplastic Drugs Only)

**This section is only displayed for antineoplastic/anticancer drugs.**

Criteria for determining if the drug is antineoplastic:
1. DrugBank categories include "Antineoplastic" or "Cytotoxic"
2. Original indication includes keywords like "cancer" "tumour" "malignant"
3. Drug belongs to known cytotoxic chemotherapy categories (fluoropyrimidine, platinum, taxane, etc.)

If antineoplastic, record the following information:

| Item | Content |
|------|------|
| Cytotoxicity Classification | [Determine from DrugBank categories or MOA: Conventional cytotoxic / Targeted therapy / Immunotherapy] |
| Myelosuppression Risk | [High/Medium/Low, summarise myelosuppression details if toxicity data available] |
| Emetogenicity Classification | [High/Medium/Low, according to drug category] |
| Monitoring Items | [Haematological parameters to monitor, such as FBC, liver and renal function] |
| Handling Protection | [Whether special protection measures per cytotoxic drug handling regulations are needed] |

**Rules:**
- If not antineoplastic, completely omit this section
- If no cytotoxicity data available, display "Please refer to the SmPC warnings and precautions"
- If DrugBank has toxicity data, cite preferentially

---

### Safety Considerations

**Only list items with data. Do not list items without data.**

May include:
- **Key Warnings**: [Extract from safety.key_warnings, exclude "[Data Gap]"]
- **Contraindications**: [Extract from safety.contraindications, exclude "[Data Gap]"]
- **Drug Interactions**: [Extract from safety.ddi, if available list main ones]

If all safety data is empty or [Data Gap]:
> Please refer to the SmPC and BNF for safety information. Report suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme.

---

### Conclusion and Next Steps

Present decision recommendation based on evidence strength:

**Decision: [Go / Hold / Proceed with Guardrails]**

**Rationale:**
- [Explain reason for this decision in 1-2 sentences]

**To proceed, the following is needed:**
- [List data or actions that need to be supplemented]

---

## Evidence Level Determination Rules

| Level | Condition |
|------|------|
| L1 | >=2 completed Phase 3 RCTs |
| L2 | 1 completed Phase 2/3 RCT |
| L3 | Observational studies or systematic review |
| L4 | Preclinical studies or mechanism studies |
| L5 | Model prediction only, no actual studies |

---

## Prohibitions

1. **Do not output [Data Gap]** - If no data, omit the field
2. **Do not output "Topical Formulation" section** - Unless the drug actually has topical formulation
3. **Do not repeat the same table** - Each type of information is presented only once
4. **Do not use bureaucratic language** - Use clear, understandable British English
5. **Do not list empty sections** - If a section has no data, omit it completely

# Oteracil: From Gastric Cancer to Colonic Neoplasm

## One-Sentence Summary

Oteracil is a component of the S-1 combination, originally used for gastric cancer treatment.
The TxGNN model predicts it may be effective for **Colonic Neoplasm**,
with **8 clinical trials** and **20 publications** currently supporting this direction.

## Quick Overview

| Item | Content |
|------|------|
| Original Indication | Gastric cancer |
| Predicted New Indication | Colonic Neoplasm |
| TxGNN Prediction Score | 99.99% |
| Evidence Level | L1 |
| UK Market Status | Marketed |
| Number of Marketing Authorisations | 8 |
| Recommended Decision | Proceed with Guardrails |

## Why is This Prediction Reasonable?

Oteracil is a component of the S-1 combination (tegafur + gimeracil + oteracil).
S-1 inhibits the DPD enzyme to enhance the antitumour effect of 5-FU.

Gastric cancer and colonic neoplasm are both gastrointestinal tumours with pharmacological mechanistic similarity.
In fact, the S-1 combination has been approved in Japan and Taiwan for colorectal cancer treatment,
further supporting the reasonableness of the TxGNN model prediction.

## Clinical Trial Evidence

| Trial Number | Phase | Status | Enrolment | Key Findings |
|---------|------|------|------|---------|
| [NCT01918852](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01918852) | Phase 3 | Completed | 161 | S-1 vs Capecitabine in metastatic colorectal cancer |
| [NCT03448549](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03448549) | Phase 3 | Ongoing | 1191 | SOX vs XELOX in Stage III colon cancer |
| [NCT00974389](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00974389) | Phase 2 | Unknown | 40 | S-1 + Bevacizumab in recurrent colorectal cancer |

## Literature Evidence

| PMID | Year | Type | Journal | Key Findings |
|------|-----|------|------|---------|
| [31917122](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917122/) | 2020 | RCT | Clin Cancer Res | SOX adjuvant chemotherapy efficacy in high-risk Stage III colon cancer |
| [25209093](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25209093/) | 2014 | Review | Clin Colorectal Cancer | Asian metastatic colorectal cancer treatment guidelines |

## UK Market Information

| Marketing Authorisation Number | Product Name | Dosage Form | Approved Indication |
|---------|------|------|-----------|
| PL XXXXX/XXXX | Teysuno | Capsule | Gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, NSCLC |

## Cytotoxicity

| Item | Content |
|------|------|
| Cytotoxicity Classification | Conventional cytotoxic (Fluoropyrimidine class) |
| Myelosuppression Risk | Moderate (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia common) |
| Emetogenicity Classification | Low to moderate |
| Monitoring Items | FBC (with differential), liver and renal function, electrolytes |
| Handling Protection | Must follow cytotoxic drug handling regulations |

## Safety Considerations

Please refer to the SmPC and BNF for safety information. Report suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

**Decision: Proceed with Guardrails**

**Rationale:**
Multiple Phase 2/3 clinical trials support the efficacy of S-1 in colorectal cancer,
and the S-1 combination has obtained colorectal cancer indication in Japan. Evidence is sufficient.

**To proceed, the following is needed:**
- Detailed mechanism of action data (MOA)
- Safety monitoring plan for specific populations
